  <h1>About</h1>
  <p>This is a demonstration of an AI bot that plays the card game <a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/12942/no-thanks">No Thanks!</a>.</p>
  <p>The bot uses a variant of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monte_Carlo_tree_search">Monte Carlo tree search</a> algorithm.
    Code for the bot is available on <a href="https://github.com/jeromematthewcelestine/mcts_no_thanks">Github</a>.</p>
  <p>Note that while the rules for <i>No Thanks!</i> advise players to keep their chips hidden from their opponents,
    nothing stops a player from keeping track of other players' chip counts.
    Therefore, in this implementation, I allow the bots to observe and rely on all players' chip counts.</p>
